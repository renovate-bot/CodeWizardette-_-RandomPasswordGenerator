ðŸŒˆ Welcome to My Code Repository! ðŸŒŸ


This repo contains a simple Python script that allows you to generate random passwords. You can easily have fun generating and saving passwords! ðŸ˜„
How to Use?

    Let the Passwords be Generated! ðŸš€: Now the script will start generating passwords! The generated passwords will be saved in the passwords.txt file.

Security Notice

The generated passwords are for educational purposes only and are not recommended for real-world use. For more secure passwords, we recommend using password managers.
